Suppose that the demand for cotton in the U.S. can be expressed as: QD = 28 â€“ 2P and that the supply can be expressed as: QS = 0.8P, where Q is measured in million bales per year and P is measured in $ per bale. What is the domestic equilibrium price, which quantity is sold? Now suppose a world market price for cotton at $5, if the U.S. were opened to international trade, would the U.S. import or export cotton? How much?

Quantity supplied and quantity demanded are given by
$$ QS = 0.8P, QD = 28 - 2P $$
At market equilibrium, the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded:
$$ 0.8P = 28 - 2P $$
$[+2P]$
$$ 2.8P = 28 $$
$[\div 2.8]$
$$ P = 10, Q = 8 $$

With $P = 5$, Consumers will demand $28-2(5)=18$, while suppliers will supply $0.8(5)=4$ Imports will be $18-4=14$

library(knitr)

supply <- function(p) {
  return( 0.8*p )
}

demand <- function(p) {
  return(28-2*p)
}

market1 <- data.frame(
  price=c(0:15)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    supply = supply(price),
    demand = demand(price)
  )

market1Narrow <- market1 %>%
gather(variable,quantity,supply:demand)

ggplot(market1Narrow,aes(quantity,price,colour=variable)) + geom_line()

kable(market1)
